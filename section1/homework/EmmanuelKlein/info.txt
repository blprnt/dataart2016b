This visual is a representation of texts between myself and my girlfriend who lives in Boston. Each circle represents a day. Each spoke represents a text, and the length of that spoke represents the number of characters within that text message. Outgoing texts (from me to her) are represented in blue while her texts to me are depicted in red. Highlighted sections on the circles are phone conversations. Phone conversations are similarly color coded based on their incoming or outgoing nature.
